<h1>The Best Movies According to Camis</h1>
<h2>My best 3 movies.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Legally Blond</h3>
<p>
    I love how it is a simple movie and also fun, 
    but it has a strong message about feminism 
    and it breaks a little of our prejudice against some kind of women.
</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>
    It makes me think about my childhood and I love the story.

</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>
    It is an awesome adventure and the film is increrible.
